Please note that this list/software serves as an aggregator of lists and does not directly manage the sourcing of records.

**Step 1:**  
Visit the following link:  
https://disposable.github.io/disposable-email-domains/lookup  

Check if your domain is still listed and identify the source of the record. If the source is not managed by this repository, please reach out to the source directly, as we do not handle source management.
